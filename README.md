# 🦊 Project Overview
 This read-me documents my responsive website for the Futureproof 2022 Gebru Cohort. 

 I designed this website about Pomskies, a cross-breed dog that has become popular in the hopes of helping others understand more about these wonderful pets. ✨

 It was an opportunity to show everyone photos of my Pomsky puppy, Mimi. I like to thank that I embraced every chance to do so in this project.
